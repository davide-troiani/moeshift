# Protected decode cache

MoEShift uses a two-tier, demand-scored LRFU cache for Qwen 3.8 Flash Next.
Configure it inside the model profile's `env` object in
`~/.config/moeshift/config.json`:

```json
{
  "LLAMA_MOE_DECODE_WINDOW": 12,
  "LLAMA_MOE_LOOKAHEAD_PREFETCH": 1,
  "LLAMA_MOE_LOOKAHEAD_PREFETCH_DEPTH": 3,
  "LLAMA_MOE_PROTECTED_SLOTS": 24
}
```

These are profile entries, not shell exports. The router isolates workers from
inherited tuning variables. Positive protected slots require window 12,
prefetch enabled and depth 3. Set protected slots to `0` to disable the
protected tier. The CLI override is `--moe-protected-slots N`.

## Slot ownership

Each enabled layer has **15 recent slots** (12 decode + 3 prefetch) and
**24 protected slots** by default: 39 physical slots in total. Recent and
protected are logical groups; promotion and demotion change metadata without
moving expert weights or tensor addresses.

- A recent hit updates recency.
- A protected hit promotes the expert to recent, demoting the oldest eligible
  recent expert when necessary.
- A miss uses a free recent slot if possible. Otherwise it selects an eligible
  recent victim and considers demoting it into the protected group.
- With no free physical slot, protected admission compares that recent expert's
  score with the lowest-scoring eligible protected expert. The recent expert is
  retained if its score is at least as high; otherwise the recent slot is reused.
- Protected score ties use age. Victim selection excludes requested experts and
  pending reads, and prefers avoiding predicted experts.

Prefetch uses the same slot policy but has no current target-layer request set.
Pending reads pin their slots until publication. Phase changes synchronize
readers and GPU work before invalidating mappings and score history.

## Demand LRFU scoring

Before slot assignment, each layer updates one score per expert for each decode
token:

```text
score[expert] = 2^(-1/32) * score[expert] + is_requested_this_token[expert]
```

Every expert selected by the actual router receives one vote, whether hit or
miss. Prefetch alone adds no votes. The fixed half-life is 32 tokens; a vote
retains 1/16 of its weight after 128 tokens. This adapts the recency-weighted
frequency idea from [LRFU](https://www.openu.ac.il/home/wiseman/2os/lru/lrfu.pdf)
to protected admission and eviction. It does not change expert selection,
weights or precision. The half-life is not a measured optimum for every workload.

## Capacity and memory

The protected-slot limit is `min(prefill bank, expert count, 1024) - 15`.
With 512 experts and a 512-slot prefill bank, valid values are 0–497.
Invalid capacities are rejected.

For the reference IQ3_XXS files, adding one protected slot to each of 48 layers
reserves 83.8144 MB of expert tensors (decimal). The default 24 slots therefore
reserve 2,011.5456 MB, plus metadata. This is tensor allocation, not total
process memory. The score vectors use 98,304 bytes (512 floats × 48 layers).

Set `env.LLAMA_MOE_QUIET` to `0` to see `protected-cache` diagnostics.
The reported recent/protected counts and expert bytes describe the active cache.

## Code and verification

- Policy: `src/llama-moe-protected-cache.h`.
- Demand, prefetch and phase integration: `src/llama-moe-slot.cpp`.
- Policy checks: `tests/test-les-protected-cache.cpp`.

```sh
cmake --build build --target test-les-protected-cache -j 8
ctest --test-dir build -R '^test-les-protected-cache$' --output-on-failure
```
